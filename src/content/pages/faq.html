                                What is a mortgage note?

                            A mortgage note is a legal document that represents a promise to repay a loan used to purchase real estate. When you sell property using owner financing (also called seller financing), you become the note holder, and the buyer makes monthly payments directly to you instead of a traditional bank or lender.                        </p>

                                What's the difference between a mortgage note and a deed of trust?                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            The mortgage note is the IOU—the promise to repay the loan with specific terms (interest rate, payment amount, duration). The deed of trust (or mortgage) is the security instrument that gives the lender a claim to the property if the borrower defaults. Think of it this way: the note is what they owe; the deed of trust is what secures it.

                                What is a performing note vs. a non-performing note?                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            A <strong>performing note</strong> means the borrower is making regular, on-time payments according to the agreed schedule. A <strong>non-performing note</strong> means the borrower has missed payments or stopped paying altogether. Both types have value and can be sold, though performing notes typically command higher prices.

                            Yes! This is called a <strong>partial note sale</strong>. You can sell a specific number of payments (such as the next 60 months) while retaining ownership of the remaining payments. This strategy provides immediate cash while preserving future income. We can help you structure a partial sale that meets your specific financial needs.

                            Note value depends on several factors including the remaining balance, interest rate, payment history, property condition and location, loan-to-value ratio, and borrower creditworthiness. Generally, notes sell at a discount to their remaining balance—this reflects the time value of money, risk, and investor return requirements. <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> for a free, no-obligation valuation of your specific note.

                            The typical timeline is 30-45 days from initial contact to closing. This includes evaluation (3-5 days), offer presentation and acceptance (1-3 days), due diligence (2-3 weeks), and closing (1 week). Urgent situations can sometimes be expedited, while complex transactions may take slightly longer. Having organized documentation ready speeds up the process considerably.                        </p>

                            The loan terms remain exactly the same—same interest rate, payment amount, and schedule. The borrower receives official notification of the ownership change and where to send future payments. Federal law protects borrowers during note transfers. Most borrowers experience minimal disruption and simply mail their payment to a different address.

                            Non-performing notes still have value because the property serves as collateral. While they sell for significantly less than performing notes, many investors specialize in purchasing non-performing notes. Selling eliminates the stress, legal costs, and uncertainty of pursuing foreclosure yourself.

                            Yes, we strongly recommend consulting with both. An attorney can review documentation and ensure your interests are protected. A CPA or tax advisor can explain the tax implications of selling your note, including capital gains treatment, and help you plan accordingly. While we provide general information, we cannot provide legal or tax advice.

                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Generally, the sale of a mortgage note is treated as a capital asset sale. Any gain (the difference between your tax basis and the sale price) is typically subject to capital gains tax—long-term rates if you've held the note over one year, short-term rates otherwise. Partial sales may have different tax treatment by spreading proceeds across multiple years. Consult with a qualified tax professional for advice specific to your situation.

                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Yes, though it affects the note's value and marketability. First position notes (first mortgages) are generally more valuable and easier to sell than second position notes because they have priority in foreclosure. We'll evaluate your note's position and find appropriate buyers regardless of its priority status.

                        </button>

                            Notes on properties in foreclosure can still be sold. In fact, many note holders prefer to sell during foreclosure to avoid the legal costs, time, and uncertainty of completing the foreclosure process themselves. The foreclosure status and stage will affect the note's value, but investors who specialize in distressed properties may still be interested.
