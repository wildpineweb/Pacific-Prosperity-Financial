                <p class="cs-text">
                    Pacific Prosperity Financial was founded by Tim Joslen, who brings over 35 years of experience in the financing and real estate industry. An entrepreneur at heart, Tim started his first business at a young age and has always been driven by a passion for helping others succeed. In 2025, he made the decision to pursue mortgage note brokering full-time, dedicating himself to bridging the gap between note holders seeking liquidity and investors looking for quality opportunities.
